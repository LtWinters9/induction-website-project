Scope of Project:
This project has been created to assist new students during the induction process
by providing students a way to find out more about the college/university they are going too by having access
to all the contact information for the place of study the student is going to.

The site will provide students with a way of interacting with other students through a blog/forum page, as well
as the student has access to a chat bot to allow them to ask simple/frequently asked questions about their place of study and
all the services provided to them.

The students have access to a document management system which will allow them to download forms and documents from google drive,
staff of the site and colleges have access to delete these files as well as upload new files for the students to access.

*Fill our scope more once more development has been done*
