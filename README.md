# Project Title

**Perth UHI Induction Website Service**

### Synopsis

This project has been created to assist new students during the induction process
by providing students a way to find out more about the college/university they are going too by having access
to all the contact information for the place of study the student is going to.

The site will provide students with a way of interacting with other students through a blog/forum page, as well
as the student has access to a chat bot to allow them to ask simple/frequently asked questions about their place of study and
all the services provided to them.

The students have access to a document management system which will allow them to download forms and documents from google drive,
staff of the site and colleges have access to delete these files as well as upload new files for the students to access. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

### Motivation

Team Project Assessment for Bsc Computing Science

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Stay what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Example Use

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
