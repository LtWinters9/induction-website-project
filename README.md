# **Perth UHI Induction Website Service**



### Synopsis

Our team of four has been tasked as discussed in the initial team meeting to create a University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) Induction Service Webpage.  As a team, we feel that the UHI would benefit from the Induction website to ease work demands on Student Services. It was also noted that UHI partnership colleges did not have this facility either. For example, the Induction Service will include a functional login system which will lead students to query the chatbot for any student related issues. There will also be an appointment / booking system if students would rather speak in person. The UHI induction system will also include a blog system for students to get to know each other before starting. Overall, this will provide an interactive experience for new students , and will allow individuals who have questions to be answered sooner before starting their first day.
