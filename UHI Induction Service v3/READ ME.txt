Why cant php,js or css able to find their folder?

-----------------------------------

../		One Directory back

../../		Two Directorys back


../../../	Three Directorys back


/		Root Directory

-----------------------------------
Annoying as this is, it is good practice to keep folders seperate, and adds an addtional layer of security.
